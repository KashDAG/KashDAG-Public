# KashDAG Public

KashDAG Public is the official transparency repository for KashDAG development,
Control Mainnet progress, network updates, release verification information, and
community-facing documentation.

This repository intentionally does **not** contain the proprietary KashDAG
protocol, validator, wallet, presale, infrastructure, or deployment source
code.

## Current status

**Stage:** Controlled mainnet operation<br>
**Network:** `kashdag-mainnet`<br>
**Active protocol:** Version 2<br>
**Protocol v2:** Activated across the canonical three-validator set<br>
**Latest signed native release:** `mainnet-v0.2.0-rc8.14`<br>
**Production onboarding release:** Ubuntu `mainnet-v0.2.0-rc8.11-linux`<br>
**Validators:** Three active validator identities<br>
**Internal pre-audit checklist:** Complete<br>
**Independent audit:** Pending<br>
**Open validator admission:** Qualification required; no candidate is counted before finalized atomic activation

Control Mainnet availability must not be interpreted as an independent audit,
production certification, investment guarantee, or unrestricted validator
admission. A downloaded node begins outside consensus and cannot affect quorum.

## Latest update

**RC8.14 signed cross-platform release published — 2026-09-03**

RC8.14 provides signed native Linux, macOS, and Windows packages with checksum
and signature evidence. The five-minute production onboarding path remains the
signed RC8.11 Ubuntu release; macOS and Windows are development and controlled-
test builds, not the production always-on validator path.

### Previous updates

**Protocol v2 pre-audit engineering milestone completed — 2026-08-12**

KashDAG has activated Protocol v2 on the public testnet and completed its
project-controlled pre-audit engineering checklist. RC7 reconciliation,
three-validator state agreement, public wallet/explorer verification,
reproducible release evidence, SDK/API consistency, recovery, monitoring,
backups, security preflight, and fault qualification are complete within the
documented testnet scope. The candidate is frozen for independent review.

This is an internal engineering-completion milestone—not an independent audit,
production certification, or mainnet approval.

## Repository purpose

This repository exists so the public can follow what KashDAG is building,
which milestones are complete, which capabilities are active, and which gates
remain. It is not an open-source distribution and grants no permission to
reproduce the proprietary implementation.
